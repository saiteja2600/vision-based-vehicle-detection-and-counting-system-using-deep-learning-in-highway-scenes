**Abstract**

**In the current era of vehicle detection, counting vehicles on the road is getting important in highway management. However, the different sizes of vehicles make it difficult for the existing systems to detect and count accurately. This project proposes a computer vision-based vehicle detection and counting system. The project uses a new high-definition highway vehicle dataset compared to the existing dataset. The proposed dataset contains minor details also, which provides an altogether foundation for a vehicle detection system based on computer vision. In this project, the highway road surface in the image is first extracted & then it has divided into a remote area and a proximal area using the segmentation method; this method is vital to improving the detection system. The above-detected areas are inserted into the YOLOv3 network, which further detects the type and location of the vehicle. After this, the final step is to detect the vehicle's trajectories and judge, based on it, the direction of the vehicle and its speed of it using the ORB algorithm. Highway videos based on different areas have been used to verify the proposed method. The results of the experiment verified that using the proposed method can detect higher detection accuracy.
